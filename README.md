# Abstract-Clock

Enter the demo [here](https://steven-liu48.github.io/Abstract-Clock/)

- This is a clock with light/dark mode depending on the time in the day. At night, the clock will have a whole different dark color scheme that's easier for the eyes to indicate that it's the night.

- I also divided each set of 12 boxes into three groups with slightly different colors so the user can calculate the time easier.
